This file describes how to run each of the 
GARCH models described below.

Three models are estimated:
  
  * The GARCH(1,1) model of Bollerslev(1986) using analytical derivatives 
    as shown in Fiorentini, Calzolari, and Panattoni (1996). The benchmark 
    model of McCullough and Renfro (1998) is estimated using data from 
    Bollerslev and Ghysels (1996). 

  * The Spline-GARCH model of Engle and Rangel (2008).  The benchmark models
    come from the OxMetrics 7.0 documentation and the Engle and Rangel paper.

  * The GARCH-MIDAS model of Engle, Rangel, and Sohn (2013). The benchmark is 
    the matlab code provided by the authors at the Review of Economic Statistics.

Most models calculate Bollerslev-Wooldridge (1992) standard errors unless otherwise noted.

To run the code:
 All the datasets are included. Some programs require the sas7bdat package to load the data.
 The code should be self contained with all functions and output in a single file.
 The GARCH-MIDAS package requires the intnx function included in intnx.py.

garch_11.py runs the GARCH(1,1) model

spgarch_er.py runs the Spline-GARCH model of Engle and Rangel (2008) on daily S&P 500 returns 

spgarch_ox.py runs the Spline-GARCH model for Nasdaq data from Laurent (2012).

midas_garch_egs.py runs the GARCH-MIDAS model for fixed window regressions on daily S&P 500 returns
